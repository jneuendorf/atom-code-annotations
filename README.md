# Code Annotations ([Atom](http://atom.io) package)

## Description

This is an atom package for creating code annotations.
An annotation is a piece of content with a title that can be displayed in [Atom](https://atom.io/).
Code Annotations will not show up in your code but can nonetheless be using along with a VCS.
Another advantage is that your annotations no longer depend on code comments meaning you can effectively comment code that does not have a comment syntax (e.g. [Support for comments in package.json](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4482)).
Annotations appear as icons in the Atom gutter and can be revealed by clicking these icons.

![Basic usage](https://github.com/jneuendorf/code-annotations/raw/master/gifs/basic-usage.gif)

By default, this package can render the following kinds of content:

- images
- html
- links / URLs
- plain text

Further renderers can be added by installing code-annotation plugin packages.


## Usage

### Creation and destruction

Code annotations can be added and deleted from the context menu, from the `ShowCommandsView`, and of course from the command palette.
When adding or removing the position is the current (or last) cursor is relevant (so just right clicking to a certain position is insufficient (for now)).
A new annotation is added above the line of the cursor; for deleting one the cursor must be at the annotation's line.

Each annotation is identified by a name (so it must be unique among all annotations of the same project folder).

When creating an annotation its contents can be set in 2 ways:

1. from a file (for e.g. images)
2. from text input (for e.g. plain text)
	- All annotations from text input are displayed as plain text first. The type can be changed later.


### Navigating to annotations

With the `show-all` command a select list containing all package commands


### Shortcuts

There are only 2: `ctrl-alt-c ctrl-alt-c` and `escape`.

Yes, the first is what it looks like - `ctr-alt-c` twice in a row.
This shortcut shows a select list with the commands of the package (so this is kinda like a prefiltered command palette).

`escape` is for hiding the container (see next section).

The reasoning behind this is to avoid conflicts with other packages without making it harder to use the package without the mouse.


### Showing annotations (rendering)

Each annotation is associated with a file. The file extension of that file determines how the file contents are rendered in the popup (called `CodeAnnotationContainer`).
Thus the `hide-container` command (which is triggered on `escape`).

The container is made visible by clicking on the icon displayed in the [gutter](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/Gutter) - currently this is a pin icon.
